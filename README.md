# Reddit-Bot

A bot project I made while trying to learn the basic of creating and maintaining it on Reddit.

# Dependencies
  >pip install praw


# Important Note
* In case you get authentication error despite confirming everything is correct, it is most likely caused by requiring the 2FA next to the password if you have 2FA enabled, syntax for that looks something like this 
     >"[password]:[2FA]"
* API used is from [here](https://api.chucknorris.io/)
* ``praw_example.ini`` should be renamed to just ``praw.ini`` and filled with correct information
